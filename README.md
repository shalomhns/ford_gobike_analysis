# (Ford GoBike Data set Exploration)


## Dataset

> Provide basic information about your dataset in this section. If you selected your own dataset, make sure you note the source of your data and summarize any data wrangling steps that you performed before you started your exploration. 
< This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. My Capstone project of Udemy Nanodegree Data Analysis Course 
> In first Part, Exploratory data visualization, l use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a 201902-fordgobike-tripdata dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
> In second Part, Explanatory data visualization, I  produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that i discovered in 201902-fordgobike-tripdata dataset.

>This data set consist of information of about 183412 individual rides of Ford GoBike data system. Its has sixteen special feature which include the duration in seconds, start time, end time, start station name, start station latitude and longitude, start and end station id, end station longitude and latitude, bike id, user type, member birth year and gender and bike share for all trip. This data is provided by Udemy for exploration and visualization analysis. The data set has no duplicate value and its within the range of a month.


## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not. 
> The descriptive analysis of the data indicate that it as a minimum of 61 second duration and maximum of 85444  duration second. There are 197 null value for the start and end station id, start station name. We also have 8265 null value for member birth year and member gender. Almost 90% of the bike user are subscriber and a little bit more than 10% are customer. 

> I was able to establish  from the exploration that user type affect bike usage in number of ride and trip duration. Subscriber make lot more trip than the customer. The busy hour falls around 7-8AM in the morning and 5-7PM. Subscriber take most of their trip during the week days from Monday to Friday while customer took their around the weekend Saturday  and Sunday. Which indicate the subscriber are probably commuters while customer are probably tourist. 



## Key Insights for Presentation

> The presentation focuses on the relationship between the trip duration in minutes and the user types 
> I start with a bar chart of the distribution of bike trip duration in minute.  Follow by the distribution of trip by the start day of the week.
> In conclusion I presented a pivot table of the weekly hourly usage of bike for customer and subscribers
